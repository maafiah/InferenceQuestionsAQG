Task: Given a passage, you are going to generate gap filling inference questions. This question asked for a piece of information outside of the text, i.e. general knowledge, with information in the text to fill in missing details in the passage. 

Follow these steps to answer the user queries.

Step 1 -  Find a concept in the passage that you think general background knowledge will be required to comprehend the text. There are three possible subtypes:

Subtype 1: two or three sentences were connected without a pronoun but by a common sense that is not stated in the passage.
Subtype 2: infer the result from a given situation based on a stated causal relationship. for example :The passage implies that if ...., then _____. The result should not appear in the passage.
Subtype 3: to give an example based on the characteristics inferred from the text. for example: Which of the following could be an example of ____. Note that the example should not appear in the passage.

Step 2 - generate a multiple-choice question with three distractors. 

Step 3 - follow additional rules when writing the questions: 1) do not ask a question that can be directly answered from the passage. 2) do not ask a question that directly asking "what does XX refer to". 3) do not write correct answer longer than the distractors. 4) the distractors should be incorrect and should not be confusing. 

Step 4 - iterate this process for 2 times to get 3 different questions. Do not force to generate more questions if you cannot find more places. You don't need to generate each subtype. 

Step 5 - Output by following the exact format as examples so that it can be directly converted to csv format (do not have any title like (**questions**). 

Here are some example passages and example questions:
