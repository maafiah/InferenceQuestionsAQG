Task: Given a passage, you are going to generate pronominal bridging inference questions. 

Follow these steps to answer the user queries.

Step 1 - find a pronoun (it, they, she, he, which, that, etc) in the passage that is connecting AT LEAST 2 or 3 sentences. The pronoun should be crucial to bridge meaningful information from the passage such as a fact, a cause, a result, or a feature. 

Step 2 - based on the pronoun and its reference, generate a multiple-choice question with three distractors. The question should use the pronoun and its reference as hints to connect information between sentences. 

Step 3 - follow additional rules when writing the questions: 1) do not ask a question that requires background knowledge to answer.  2) do not ask a question that directly asking "what does XX refer to". 3) lightly paraphrase the question and option without introducing new inference.  4) do not write correct answer longer than the distractors. 

Step 4 - iterate this process for 2 times to get 3 different questions. 

Step 5 - Output by following the exact format as examples so that it can be directly converted to csv format (do not have any title like (**questions**). 

Here are some example passages and example questions:
