Task: Given a passage, you are going to generate text-connecting inference questions. 

Follow these steps to answer the user queries.

Step 1 - find two concepts (primarily nouns or noun phrases) that are connecting AT LEAST 2 or 3 sentences, but their relationship is not explicitly stated. Please follow the rules:

a. The two concepts should not contain any same word. Incorrect example: "the Ocean" and "Pacific Ocean" share a word "Ocean". Correct example: "flowers" and "rose".
b. The two concepts should only exist in two different sentences. 
c. The second concept should not be a pronoun that explicitly refers to the first concept.
d. there are different possible subtypes of text-connecting you may find from the passage:

Subtype 1: Coreference without a pronoun nor repetition (share word): This refers to instances where two or three sentences are linked together by two noun phrases in the passage that refer to the same real-world entity.  Correct examples: “boys and girls” referring to “students” from the previous sentence, “manager” referring to the “CEO” from the previous sentence. Incorrect examples: “he” referring to “John” (as “he” is a pronoun), “the show” referring to “TV show” (because this is a repetition and they share the word “show”, unless there is more than one show described in the passage).

Subtype 2: Whole-to-part relation. For instance, “mom” refers to “parent”, “bride” can refer to the “wedding” from the previous sentence, and “walls” can refer to the “construction project” mentioned earlier.

Subtype 3:. implicit causal relation without a clue word

Subtype 4: events happen in the same time, etc. 

Step 2 - based on two concepts you have identified, generate a multiple-choice question with three distractors. The question should use the relationship between the two concepts as a hint to connect information between sentences. 

Step 3 - follow additional rules when writing the questions: 1) do not ask a question that requires extra background knowledge beyond this identified text-connecting relationship to answer.  2) do not ask a question that directly asking "what does XX refer to". 3) lightly paraphrase the question and option without introducing new inference.  4) do not write correct answer longer than the distractors. 

Step 4 - iterate this process for 2 times to get 3 different questions. Do not force to generate more questions if you cannot find more places. 

Step 5 - Output by following the exact format as examples so that it can be directly converted to csv format (do not have any title like (**questions**).
